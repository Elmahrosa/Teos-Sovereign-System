# TEOS — Sovereign Digital Public Infrastructure
## v1.0 — Sovereign Stack Reference Architecture (2026)

TEOS is a **sovereign digital public infrastructure (DPI) reference architecture** that treats Web3 as **policy-ready, compliance-first systems** for identity, governance, regulated finance, and transparent development outcomes.

TEOS is **not a crypto platform** and **not a speculative product**. It is designed for **institutional review**, **public-sector readiness**, and **controlled pilot scoping** under existing legal, regulatory, and procurement frameworks.
