## 📍 Repository Standing

This repository is the **sovereign execution kernel**
of the **TEOS / Elmahrosa Sovereign Stack**.

It is the **only authorized system layer** permitted to translate:
- constitutional doctrine
- governance decisions
- compliance determinations
- AI guard and audit outcomes

into **enforceable, auditable system execution**.

**Founder & Authority:** Elmahrosa International — TEOS Egypt  
**Founder:** Ayman Seif

## 🏛️ Constitutional Authority (Read First)

All legitimacy and authority derive from the **International Civic Blockchain Constitution**:

https://github.com/Elmahrosa/International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution

Governance stewardship and lifecycle control are anchored in:

- **TEOS-FORGE — Stewardship Anchor**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/TEOS-FORGE

License authority is governed by the **canonical TESL**:

- https://github.com/Elmahrosa/International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution/blob/main/LICENSE

This repository operates **strictly subordinate** to the above authorities.

---

## 🌍 Sovereign Doctrine

**Born in Egypt for the World**  
*Built in Egypt. Engineered for Nations. Scaled for the World.*

Governance precedes execution.  
Institutions precede protocols.  
Humans precede AI.

This kernel **executes authority** — it does not create it.

Web3, AI, and distributed systems are **execution tools**, never sources of sovereignty.

---

## 🎯 What This Repository Is

**Teos-Sovereign-System** is the **operational kernel** of TEOS.

It is responsible for:
- binding governance-approved decisions to runtime execution
- enforcing compliance outcomes before any action occurs
- coordinating AI Guard and AI Auditor requirements
- routing approved operations to APIs, SDKs, and service layers
- enforcing revocation, suspension, rollback, and override actions

> No API, service, AI system, or application  
> may execute sovereign actions **without passing through this kernel**.

---

## 🚫 What This Repository Is Not

- Not a governance engine (see **TEOS-Governance**)
- Not a compliance ruleset (see **TEOS-Egypt-Compliance-Kit**)
- Not an AI decision-maker
- Not a public API gateway
- Not a permissionless protocol or DAO
- Not an open-source commercial platform

---

## 🔗 Mandatory Execution Chain

All sovereign actions **must** follow this sequence:

**Constitution**  
→ **TEOS-FORGE**  
→ **TEOS-Governance**  
→ **Compliance Layer**  
→ **AI Guard / AI Auditor**  
→ **Teos-Sovereign-System (this kernel)**  
→ **APIs / SDKs / Services**

Any attempt to bypass this chain is **non-compliant and unauthorized**.

---

## 🧠 Core Responsibilities

| Domain | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Authority Binding | Execute only formally approved decisions |
| Compliance Binding | Block execution on failed jurisdictional checks |
| AI Control | Execute AI outputs only after human approval |
| Revocation | Immediate suspension, rollback, or termination |
| Audit Hooks | Emit immutable evidence for TEOS-AI-Auditor |

---

## 🔌 Ecosystem Dependencies

This kernel integrates with:
- **TEOS-Governance** — policy and authority rules
- **TEOS-Egypt-Compliance-Kit** — jurisdictional enforcement
- **TEOS-AI-Guard** — AI safety gates
- **TEOS-AI-Auditor** — audit and evidence export
- **TEOS-Identity-Insight-AI** — identity risk intelligence
- **TEOS-API-Sovereign** — governed API & SDK gateway

All downstream systems **must defer** to this kernel.

---

## ⚠️ Usage Notice

Any deployment, fork, or integration that executes actions
outside this kernel or bypasses governance, compliance,
or audit requirements is **invalid and unauthorized**.

AI systems are **decision-support only**.  
**Final authority remains human and sovereign.**
