# 🏛️ Teos Sovereign System | ELMAHROSA

**Sovereign Kernel (OS) for Governed Digital Public Infrastructure**

---

## 📍 Repository Standing

This repository is the **sovereign kernel** (the “operating constitution in code”)
of the **TEOS / Elmahrosa Sovereign Stack**.

It defines the foundational system model that all TEOS modules must follow:
- governance-first execution
- compliance-first constraints
- identity-first trust
- auditability-first operations

**Founder & Owner:** Elmahrosa International — TEOS Egypt  
**Founder Authority:** Ayman Seif

## Constitutional Authority (Read First)

All legitimacy and authority derive from:

- **International Civic Blockchain Constitution (Single Source of Truth):**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution

Governance stewardship and lifecycle control are anchored in:

- **TEOS-FORGE (Stewardship Anchor):**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/TEOS-FORGE

License authority is governed by:

- **TEOS Egypt Sovereign License (TESL):**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution/blob/main/LICENSE

## Sovereign Doctrine

**Born in Egypt for the World**  
*Built in Egypt. Engineered for Nations. Scaled for the World.*

Elmahrosa defines governance.  
Nations retain authority.  
Technology executes under control.

Web3 is an execution layer — never a replacement for law, institutions, or human authority.

---

## What This Repository Is

**Teos-Sovereign-System** is the kernel layer that defines:
- sovereign system primitives (actors, roles, authority tiers)
- governance-to-execution flows (request → review → decision → enforcement)
- compliance gates (jurisdiction profiles, policy checks)
- audit requirements (immutable events, evidence export)
- interoperability boundaries (adapters require approval)

> This repository is **not a product** and **not a DAO**.  
> It is a sovereign system design intended for national and institutional adoption.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- Not a permissionless protocol that overrides governance
- Not a community-run governance substitute
- Not an open-source platform for unrestricted commercial use
- Not a standalone SaaS

---

## Core System Model (Kernel View)

### Authority Tiers (Reference)
- **Tier 0:** Sovereign Root (stewardship continuity)
- **Tier 1:** Government Authority
- **Tier 2:** Regulator Authority
- **Tier 3:** Institution Operator
- **Tier 4:** System Automation (execution only)

### Required Flow
Governance decision **must precede** execution:

Constitution → TEOS-FORGE → Governance → Compliance → Execution → Audit

---

## Ecosystem Dependencies

This kernel governs and is consumed by:
- **TEOS-API-Sovereign** (single governed gateway: APIs + SDK)
- **TEOS-Governance** (rules of authority and enforcement)
- **TEOS-Egypt-Compliance-Kit** (regulatory mapping and controls)
- **TEOS-Identity-Insight-AI** (identity risk intelligence)
- Payment, wallet, bankchain, and sector modules (execution layer)

All dependent repos must remain compatible with this kernel model.

---

## ⚠️ Usage Notice

Any deployment, fork, or integration that bypasses governance, compliance gates,
or audit requirements is **non-compliant and unauthorized**.

AI is **decision-support only**.  
Final authority remains **human and sovereign**.

|------|-------------|
| System Orchestration | Coordinated execution of sovereign modules |
| Policy Enforcement | Binding governance rules into runtime logic |
| Jurisdiction Profiles | National and regulatory configuration |
| Identity & Compliance | Hooks to identity, audit, and enforcement layers |
| Interoperability | Controlled bridges to approved technologies |
| Auditability | End-to-end traceability for institutions |

## Core Principles

1. Constitution before code  
2. Governance before execution  
3. Human authority before automation  
4. Sovereignty before decentralization  
5. Accountability before scale
