# Sovereign Stack Architecture

TEOS is a **layered sovereign digital public infrastructure (DPI) architecture**.  
Each layer is modular, auditable, and deployable independently, while remaining interoperable.

## 1. Identity Layer — T-ID

**Module:** T-ID  
**Role:** Foundational digital identity and credential layer.

- Credential issuance and verification
- Eligibility checks and access control
- Selective disclosure for privacy and data minimization

## 2. Governance Layer — T-Gov

**Module:** T-Gov  
**Role:** Transparent decision-making and proposal lifecycle management.

- Proposal creation, review, and lifecycle management
- Voting rules (quorum, weights, roles) and configuration
- Immutable decision logs for audit and oversight

## 3. Financial Layer — T-Finance, T-Stake

**Modules:** T-Finance, T-Stake  
**Role:** Regulated financial record-keeping and participation incentives.

- Regulated transaction recording (not a core banking replacement)
- Program disbursement logs and settlement references
- Participation proofs and policy-controlled incentives (T-Stake)

## 4. Asset & Infrastructure Layer — T-RWA, T-Infra, T-Green, T-Work

**Modules:** T-RWA, T-Infra, T-Green, T-Work  
**Role:** Transparent registries and execution rails for assets, infrastructure, ESG, and workforce.

- Asset registries and lifecycle tracking (T-RWA)
- Infrastructure, ports, logistics, and smart cities records (T-Infra)
- ESG/carbon/renewable program records (T-Green)
- Workforce credentialing and program participation (T-Work)

## 5. Compliance & Audit Layer — T-Audit

**Module:** T-Audit  
**Role:** Cross-cutting compliance and oversight evidence layer.

- Immutable audit logs across identity, governance, finance, and assets
- Evidence packaging for independent audits
- Role-based oversight and supervisory access

## 6. Integration & Interoperability Layer — T-API, T-Bridge, T-FDI

**Modules:** T-API, T-Bridge, T-FDI  
**Role:** Institutional APIs, inter-jurisdictional interoperability, and FDI monitoring.

- Secure APIs for integration with government, banking, and enterprise systems (T-API)
- Interoperability across jurisdictions and systems (T-Bridge)
- Investment and FDI monitoring dashboards and reporting (T-FDI)

## Cross-Layer Principles

- **Compliance-First:** All layers are designed for auditability, regulatory alignment, and safeguards.
- **Sovereignty:** Identity, data policy, and governance remain under national or institutional control.
- **Modular Adoption:** Layers can be adopted incrementally around existing legacy systems.
- **Monitoring & Evaluation:** SDG-aligned outputs and outcomes can be derived from events across layers.
