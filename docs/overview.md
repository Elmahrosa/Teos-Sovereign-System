# TEOS Overview

TEOS is a **sovereign Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)** reference architecture for governments, regulators, and development partners.

It treats Web3 as **policy-ready, compliance-first infrastructure** for:

- Identity and verifiable credentials (T-ID)
- Governance and decision traceability (T-Gov)
- Regulated financial records and reporting (T-Finance, T-Stake)
- Asset registries and infrastructure transparency (T-RWA, T-Infra, T-Green, T-Work)
- Audit-ready compliance and oversight (T-Audit)
- Institutional integration and FDI monitoring (T-API, T-Bridge, T-FDI)

## Institutional Posture

- **Compliance-First:** Aligned with regulatory, audit, and safeguards expectations.
- **Sovereign:** Designed for national control over identity, governance rules, and data policy.
- **Non-Speculative:** TEOS is not a token or trading platform and does not depend on speculative markets.
- **Integration-Friendly:** Works alongside existing systems (ID, finance, registries) rather than replacing them.

## Intended Use

- Exploratory institutional review
- Technical and policy dialogue
- Controlled, non-disruptive pilots under applicable legal and regulatory frameworks
