# Security Policy

TEOS is currently provided as a **documentation and reference architecture**.  
Any concrete implementation based on these materials must undergo its own security review.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability or security issue in:

- Any reference implementation derived from this architecture, or
- Any example code or sample configuration linked from this repository,

please:

1. **Do not disclose the issue publicly.**
2. Send a responsible disclosure report to: **aams1916@gmail.com**  
3. Include, where possible:
   - A clear description of the issue and impact
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Suggested mitigations or workarounds

## Scope and Expectations

- This repository itself contains **documentation**, not production code.
- Any deployed system using this architecture should be subject to:
  - Independent security review and testing
  - Threat modeling and risk assessment
  - Audit and controls verification
  - Compliance validation per jurisdiction (e.g., data protection, financial regulation)

Security posture and controls must be tailored to each institution and deployment context.
