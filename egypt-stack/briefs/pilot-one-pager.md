# TEOS Sovereign DPI Pilot — Concept Note (One Page)
**For Ministries, DFIs, and Development Partners**  
**Status:** Exploratory, Non-Binding | **Version:** v1.0

---

## 1. Purpose

This pilot explores **TEOS** as a **sovereign Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) reference architecture** to strengthen:

- Transparency and auditability of public programs
- Governance and oversight of decisions and spending
- SDG-aligned Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E)
- Safer, more traceable cooperation with development and private partners

The pilot is **non-disruptive**: it operates alongside existing systems and does **not** replace national ID, core banking, statutory registries, or legal mandates.

---

## 2. Pilot Scope (Illustrative)

**Domain (example):** A targeted public program, such as:
- Education (scholarships, training, skills programs)
- Health (primary care support, maternal health, digital vouchers)
- Infrastructure (municipal works, ports, logistics improvements)
- Green / climate (renewable incentives, energy efficiency programs)

**TEOS modules in scope (example):**
- **T-ID** — Eligibility & credential layer (who is eligible, under what criteria)
- **T-Gov** — Proposal and approval workflows (what is decided, by whom, and when)
- **T-Finance** — Program-level disbursement logs (what was spent, linked to approvals)
- **T-Audit** — Immutable audit logs and evidence packaging (what occurred, and how verified)
- **T-API** — Integration with existing systems where required

**Pilot size (example):**
- 1–2 programs or sub-programs  
- 1–3 participating agencies/departments  
- Limited number of beneficiaries and institutional partners  
- Defined start/end dates and evaluation criteria

## 3. Objectives & Expected Outcomes

### Primary Objectives
1. Demonstrate improved **traceability** from **eligibility → decision → disbursement → audit**
2. Validate institutional fit across:
   - governance roles and workflows  
   - compliance and legal alignment  
   - data protection and safeguards  
3. Establish a shared operating model between:
   - government agencies  
   - DFIs/development partners  
   - regulators and oversight institutions  

### Expected Outcomes
- Documented end-to-end operational flow and controls
- SDG- and sector-tagged data for M&E dashboards
- Pilot evaluation report with:
  - lessons learned  
  - risks and mitigations  
  - scale-up options or discontinuation recommendation  

---

## 4. Key Metrics (Illustrative)

### A) Transparency & Traceability
- % of disbursements **linked to explicit approvals** (T-Gov references)
- % of key actions with a **complete audit trail** (T-Audit coverage)
- Average time to **reconstruct a case trail** (decision + spending + evidence)

### B) Governance & Compliance
- % of decisions passing through **documented workflows**
- Count of recorded **compliance/safeguards checks**
- Number of **exceptions/overrides**, with recorded rationale and approvals

### C) Operational Efficiency
- Cycle time: proposal → approval → disbursement (baseline vs pilot)
- Reduction in manual reconciliation steps
- Staff usability and workload feedback (survey-based)

### D) Monitoring & SDG Alignment
- Number of events tagged to **program-relevant SDG indicators**
- Timeliness of monitoring data available to M&E teams
- Dashboard usage patterns (frequency + feedback)

---

## 5. Safeguards & Risk Management

### Legal & Policy
- Pilot operates **under existing laws and regulations**
- Data protection and privacy assessment prior to launch
- Clear designation of roles (data controller, operator, oversight)

### Technical & Security
- Sandbox or limited-scope environment
- Role-based access control and minimum-access principles
- Security review of architecture and access controls

### Financial & Fiduciary
- TEOS functions as a **recording and traceability layer**, not a bank
- No speculative or volatile instruments; no consumer trading
- Funds continue to flow through existing, regulated channels

### Governance & Accountability
- Defined escalation path for issues and complaints
- Inclusion of audit and oversight institutions in review
- Agreed protocol to pause or terminate the pilot if risks emerge

---

## 6. Roles & Responsibilities (Illustrative)

- **Lead Ministry / Agency** — Owns use case, policy decisions, operational leadership  
- **Digital / ICT Authority** — Technical oversight, cybersecurity, integration governance  
- **Finance / Treasury** — Alignment with public financial management rules  
- **Regulators & Oversight Bodies** — Safeguards review, audit readiness, evaluation input  
- **DFIs / Development Partners** — Technical assistance, evaluation support, capacity building (as applicable)

---

## 7. Next Steps (Illustrative)

1. Confirm pilot domain and scope  
2. Requirements gathering and legal/compliance review  
3. Configure TEOS modules for pilot environment  
4. Train staff and oversight stakeholders  
5. Run pilot with checkpoints and defined timeframe  
6. Independent evaluation and lessons learned  
7. Decision: scale-up, adapt and retest, or discontinue
