# Web3 as Digital Public Infrastructure

Within TEOS, Web3 is implemented as **policy-ready Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**—not as consumer speculation.

TEOS frames Web3 as an enabling layer for:
- secure, verifiable identity
- accountable governance workflows
- regulated finance and reporting
- transparent registries and oversight
- measurable development outcomes

This framing supports institutional adoption under:
- regulatory requirements
- audit and oversight expectations
- procurement constraints
- safeguards and data protection regimes
