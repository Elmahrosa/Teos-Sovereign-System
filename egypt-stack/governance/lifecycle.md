# Repository Governance

This repository documents a **sovereign DPI reference architecture**.  
It is intended for institutional review, not for speculative promotion.

## Content Standards

Contributions should align with the following posture:

- **Compliance-First Language**
  - Emphasize safeguards, regulatory alignment, and auditability.
- **Institutional Framing**
  - Use terms such as Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), safeguards, M&E, and oversight.
- **Non-Speculative Positioning**
  - Avoid token marketing, price discussion, or roadmap claims that sound like investment promises.

## Governance Lifecycle (Documentation Context)

Changes to this reference architecture should:

1. Be proposed via issues or pull requests with clear rationale.
2. Consider policy, compliance, and institutional-readiness implications.
3. Preserve the non-committal, reference-only nature of the materials.
4. Include updates to diagrams and cross-references where relevant.
5. Maintain auditability of changes via version control history.

For the **system governance lifecycle** (identity → governance → compliance → execution → monitoring), see `governance/governance-lifecycle.md`.
